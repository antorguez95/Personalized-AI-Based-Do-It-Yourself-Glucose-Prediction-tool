"""The execution of this script generates a .csv file with the format of the Abbot-generated files.
Only CGM data is include, and readings are generated every 15 minutes, as the data that have 
been used for the development of this tool. Everytime this script is executed, a new file is generated,
just in case someone wants to use this with different files. CGM lectures are fake, and its shape and 
trends do not intend to imitate real individual's phisiolgy or interstitial glucose patterns. This is jusy
for testing purposes. No interruptions will be generated, and a year and a half data is generated to be able
to generate the AI model and provide a new prediction with newer data. The file name corresponds to the format
generated by Abbot's: IDXXX_SXXX_RXXX_glucose_dd-mm-yyyy.csv.
