def get_model(N: int, input_features: int = 1) -> Model:
    """RReturns a LSTM [1] for CGM single step forecasting whose number of memory units 
    depends on the lenght of the input features (N).The Prediction Horizon of the model 
    is defined by the previously generated training dataset since it does not influence
    the model's architecture.

    Args:
    -----
        N (int): Number of samples in the input tensor. Must be multiple of 2.
        input_features (int): Number of features in the input tensor.

    
    Returns:
    --------
        model (Model): LSTM-model instance.
